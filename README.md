# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project is entitled Fortnite API and the site is located at:

https://www.fortnite-api.com

It is not currently deployed as it is not fully functional.

It will be deployed on Heroku and I will include the link here when that is complete.

I first started building the app with create-react-app but soon realized that it would be wiser to build with Vite. That is why this is version 2 of the capstone.

I used Routes to build my navbar at the top of the page and bootstrap to help with styling. From there I worked on accessing my API with useEffect and fetch and was unsuccessful with being able to show data in the browser.

From there I built a card component to hold the data from the API in a graphical way so the user could find the info quickly. I used this twice, once in the Item Shop Updates page and secondly in the Battle Royale News page.

I finished modifying the css to make the app simplistic yet visually appealing and similar to the item shop page that is currently in the Fortnite game.

I hope to get this working and expand on the app in the future to add more features from the API.
