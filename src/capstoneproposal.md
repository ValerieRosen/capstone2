Capstone Proposal

For my Capstone project I am looking to create an app that uses the Fortnite API to access the Fortnite Item Shop to display new items that are updated daily in the shop. I also plan to include Battle Royale News data from the API and display it on a separate page with a navigation bar at the top. My tech stack will include React and Node and I will use create-react-app.

My intent is to focus on both front-end and back-end by using routes and components on the backend and stylize the pages using CSS.

This will be able to be viewed as a website and on a mobile browser with repsonsiveness and accessibility in mind.

The goal of this site will allow users to gain access to items that are new in the Fortnite Item Shop as well as any latest news happenings in the Battle Royale game.

My demographic is gamers of any age that enjoy playing Fortnite.

I am planning on using an unofficial Fortnite API found at http://www.fortnite-api.com

The steps I plan on taking in order to create my Fortnite Capstone Project are as follows:

I. Set up development environment
a. Install Node and create-react-app and create a new project called fortnite-updates.
b. Initialize repository.
c. Use Insomnia to access API and test GET requests for data that is returned and choose what values will be displayed.

II. Create components
a. Use data from Insomnia to choose what is displayed for the user (ie. Item Shop Updates/Battle Royale News)
b. Create simple components for each page including navbar and routes.

III. Fetch data from Fortnite API
a. Use componentDidMount to fetch data from Fortnite API when component mounts
b. Make HTTP requests to Fortnite API using built-in fetch API
c. Parse the data received from the API and update the component's state accordingly

IV. Display data
a. Once data is fetched from the API and stored in the component's state, display it in React components.
b. Use HTML elements to display data or possibly research third-party library such as Material-UI.

V. Implement navbar
a. Add a stylized navbar and make sure routes are functioning properly.

VI. Optimize and Refactor
a. Optimize code for performance and readability and add necessary comments.

VII. Test application
a. Test application in many different ways and write unit tests to automate the process.

VIII. Deploy application
a. Deploy to Heroku and test functionality once again.
