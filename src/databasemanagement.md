Database Management

The API I will be using for my capstone is a Fortnite API located at https://www.fortnite-api.com . The dashboard and docs are located at https://dash.fortnite-api.com .

I will be using GET requests to access the New Cosmetics items in the item shop via
https://fortnite-api.com/v2/cosmetics/br/new

I will also be using GET requests to access the Battle Royale news via
https://fortnite-api.com/v2/news/br

Both links return JSON which will be parsed to display the data on the web page.
